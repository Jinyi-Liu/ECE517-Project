# ECE 517 Reinforcement Learning Project
This repository is about the project of ECE517 Reinforcement Learning (Fall 2023).

## Problem Statement

In this project, we employ deep reinforcement learning to solve the inventory management problem. It shows that deep reinforcement learning can be used to solve the inventory management problem. We also compare the performance of deep reinforcement learning with the performance of the classical inventory management model.
